A JS challenge to create an mosaic with photos and associated sound clips

Proposed order of completion:

* Display grid of images from a data source
* Play the associated sound when an image is clicked
* Overlay a play/pause control on hover over an image and implement pause

Inspired by this [Boston Globe mosaic][bgm]
