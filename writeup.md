# Description
In this challenge, you're going to create a mosaic with photos and associated sound clips. Instead of uploading files, you'll be using Instagram pics and sound clips from the Boston Globe.
There are three steps to this challenge. Once completed, your code will:

* Display a grid of images from a data source (in this case, the Boston Globe)
* Play the associated sound when an image is clicked
* Overlay a play/pause control on hover over an image and implement pause

The Boston Globe mosaic served as inspiration for this project. When you're finished, you'll have made an alternate version of the "mosaic" view on the following page: [Boston Globe mosaic][bgm]

# Learning Objectives

By the end of the challenge, you will have some experience with the following technical concepts:

## Basic
* defining variables that contain Strings, Functions and Objects
* declaring variables with the var keyword to prevent them from being defined at the global scope
* passing functions as arguments to other functions
* understanding that every function creates a new scope for variable names
* grouping related functions into objects to avoid namespace collisions
* understanding 'this' in the context of a function

## Intermediate
* writing JS functions to create links to source data via a baseURL variable and an array of strings
* using JS and HTML data attributes to render an item from an HTML template
* rendering HTML to the DOM
* embedding media into the HTML document using the HTML5 <audio> element
* programmatically controlling embedded media with JS code, such as .play(), .stop(), and .pause (defined in the [nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement) interface used to implement media elements.
* using event listeners to play and stop sounds when the user clicks on particular DOM elements
